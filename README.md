# ocean_tools

This is more or less a clone of my local ~/MATLAB directory, which contains functions to carry out common tasks for oceanographic data analysis. Many of them are very simple, but somewhere along the line I found the tasks they complete annoying enough to want to throw them into dedicated functions. Check the individual docs for details.
